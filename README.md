# Fingerphoto-Dataset
This dataset is inspired by the following paper [On Matching Finger-selfies using Deep Scattering Networks](http://iab-rubric.org/papers/2020_TBIOM_Fphoto.pdf)

We have collected this dataset using a crowd sourcing platform (Amazon mTurk). This dataset was collected over three batches. Each worker has submitted 20 images in total, comprised of 10 for the index finger and 10 for the middle finger. The images are taken for the same hand, Taken by a mobile camera and using flash.


So during this experiment we collected 2340 fingerphoto images.


Below we display tables detailing each batch.

## FingerPhoto Dataset (Amazon mTurk)-first batch :

| Total Number of HIT submissions      | 71 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Accepted      | 47  (44 some workers deleted their folders)     |
| Rejected   | 20        |
| Pending for access    | 4       |
| Total number of Images   | 940   ( 47 (submission)x 20 (image))     |




## FingerPhoto Dataset (crowdwork)-second batch :

| Total Number of HIT submissions       | 30 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Accepted      | 14       |
| Rejected   | 12        |
| Pending for access   | 4        |
| Total number of Images    | 280    (14(submission)x20(image))    |
| Rejected   | 12        |



*940(first batch)+280(second batch)=1220 images*

 

## FingerPhoto Dataset (crowdwork)-third batch :

| Total Number of HIT submissions      | 125 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Accepted      | 56       |
| Rejected   | 52        |
| Pending for access    | 17        |
| Total number of Images    | 1120  (56(submission)x20(image))      |

 


## 1220 (First and Second batch) + 1120 (Third batch) = 2340 images collected.

 

 

So during this experiment we collected 2340 fingerphoto images. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
This experimant was fully personaly funded. you will find both the images and the labels in json file format that containes the coordinates to crop the exact fingerprint. i will also upload the python notebook that does the cropping for you.

This dataset is made (Truly) publicaly available for people to expand on this field and contriute their knowledge.
