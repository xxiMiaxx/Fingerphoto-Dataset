# Fingerphoto-Dataset
This dataset is inspired by the following paper [On Matching Finger-selfies using Deep Scattering Networks](http://iab-rubric.org/papers/2020_TBIOM_Fphoto.pdf)

We have collected this dataset using a crowd sourcing platform (Amazon mTurk). This dataset was collected over three batches. Each worker has submitted 20 images in total, comprised of 10 for the index finger and 10 for the middle finger. The images are taken for the same hand.


So during this experiment we collected 2340 fingerphoto images.
Collected Fingerphoto dataset:

During my work with the freelancer we collected the images in three batches, below is a table detailing each batch.

FingerPhoto Dataset (Amazon mTurk)-first batch:

| Total Number of HIT submissions      | 71 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Accepted      | 47  (44 some workers deleted their folders)     |
| Rejected   | 20        |
| Pending for access    | 4       |
| Total number of Images   | 940   ( 47 (submission)x 20 (image))     |




 







 





FingerPhoto Dataset (crowdwork)-second batch:

Total Number of HIT submissions 

30

Accepted

14

Rejected 

12

Pending for access 

4

Total number of Images 

280

14(submission)x20(image)

 

940(first batch)+280(second batch)=1220 images

 

FingerPhoto Dataset (crowdwork)-third batch:

Total Number of HIT submissions 

125

Accepted

56

Rejected 

52

Pending for access 

17

Total number of Images 

1120

56(submission)x20(image)

 

1220 (First and Second batch) + 1120 (Third batch) = 2340 images collected.

 

 

So during this experiment we collected 2340 fingerphoto images. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
